            <p>
                Hi, I'm Gergana, a game designer with a love for creating immersive and visually stunning gaming experiences.
                I studied in New Bulgarian University with module - "Computer Games Technologies" and i have almost 2 years professional experience as a Level/Game Designer.
                I've been playing games all my life and i've always wanted to work in the gaming industry. My dream is to make memorable games that will be played with excitement.
                I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow as a designer, whether that means learning new techniques, experimenting with different art styles, or exploring new genres of gaming.
                I believe that the key to success in game design is a willingness to take risks and push the boundaries of what is possible.
                Whether I'm working on character designs, level layouts, or game mechanics, I always strive to create something that is both visually appealing and engaging for the player.
                With my love for gaming, attention to detail, and commitment to excellence, I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to any game development project.

            <p>
                One of my recent games is Forest 0: The dead end. It's a first person horror/survival game. The goal is to escape from the forest through a portal
                which is hidden somewhere in the forest.
                <br />The game is filled with mythology creatures which can help or hinder the player in his journey.
                <br /> The game is built in Unreal Engine 5. The terrair is made by imported heighmap and the foliage is painted by foliage tool. I've used Megascans for the assets and the character is made by MakeHuman.
                <br /> I'm working on a FPS game at the moment, learning Blender and Maya too, but i still have much work to do, so i'll update my projects soon.
